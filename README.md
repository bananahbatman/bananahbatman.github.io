### My uninformed thoughts on programming languages

#### Python:
Currently, my favorite programming language is Python. This is largely due to it's simplicity, which ideal for getting dumb project ideas out of my head and in code form quickly. 

**To further convey my love for Python here are some quotes from famous Computer Scientists:**

**In the words of Paul Dubois**
> Python is the most powerful language you can still read.

**In the words of Me**
> Python is the slang of Coding Languages

#### C++:
On the other hand, I have great appreciation for C++ and how much control it gives you. This has led me to the belief that C++ is quite guillible. While, I am flattered that C++ assumes I know what I'm doing, I have ruthlessly pranked it many times with segmentation faults.

**Git:**

``` 
Push Rejected, Rebase or Merge 
```

**Me:**

```
git push --force
```
